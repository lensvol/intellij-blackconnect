Simple plugin for IDEA intended to help you to avoid overhead from starting [black](https://github.com/psf/black) process each time you save a Python file.

Instead, on each press of `Alt + Shift + B` plugin will send contents of the current Python file to the [blackd](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/blackd.html) and replace them with the formatted version (if any changes were made at all).

## Features

* Automatic handling of Python type stubs (`.pyi`).
* Ability to trigger on each file save.
* Rough support for Jupyter Notebook files.
* Configurable options:
    * Hostname and port.
    * Preferred line length (default: 88).
    * Skipping sanity checks ("fast mode").
    * Skipping string normalization.
    * Target specific Python versions.
* Ability to reformat selected fragment only instead of whole file. 
* Load formatting settings from **[tool.black]** section of `pyproject.toml`

## Installation

#### Development Snapshot

...or just compile it straight from the source code:

## TODOs

* Spawn **blackd** process if not started already.
* Make plugin properly [dynamic](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/plugin_structure/dynamic_plugins.html).
* "Live reformatting".
* Automatic detection of applicable Python frameworks.
* Get line length from Python code style settings.
