Simple plugin for IDEA intended to help you to avoid overhead from starting [black](https://github.com/psf/black) process each time you save a Python file.

Instead, on each press of `Alt + Shift + B` plugin will send contents of the current Python file to the [blackd](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/blackd.html) and replace them with the formatted version (if any changes were made at all).

## Features

* Ability to trigger on each file save.
* Automatic handling of Python type stubs (`.pyi`).
* Rough support for Jupyter Notebook files.
* Ability to reformat selected fragment only instead of whole file.
* Load formatting settings from **[tool.black]** section of `pyproject.toml`
* Configurable options:
    * Hostname, port and https.
    * Preferred line length (default: 88).
    * Skipping sanity checks ("fast mode").
    * Skipping string normalization.
    * Target specific Python versions.

## Installation

**NB:** If you plan on triggering reformat on each save, please make sure to disable features in other plugins (e.g. [Save Actions](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions)) which may trigger standard "Reformat code" action. 

Also, please make sure to disable **black** in "Settings / Tools / File Watchers" if you installed it previously using [the example from documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html).

#### Stable version

Just go to the [plugin page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14321-blackconnect) in *JetBrains Plugins Repository* and press `Install to IDE`.

#### Early Access Preview

Be brave and try out "early access preview" version:
* Open *"Preferences"*
* Select *"Plugins"* tab
* Click on the gear icon and choose *"Manage plugin repositories"*
* Add [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/14321](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/14321) to the list of repositories
* Find **BlackConnect** in the Marketplace, version should have suffix *"EAP-[timestamp]"*

#### Development Snapshot

...or just compile it straight from the source code:

* Open this project in IDEA.
* Open _Gradle_ side tab and run `buildPlugin` task.
* After project is built, open your favorite IDEA-based IDE.
* In **Preferences** window, choose *Plugins* pane and click on the gear icon.
* Choose `Install Plugin from Disk` and point it to ZIP file in the `build/distributions` directory.

## TODOs

* Spawn **blackd** process if not started already.
* Make plugin properly [dynamic](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/plugin_structure/dynamic_plugins.html).
* "Live reformatting".
* Automatic detection of applicable Python frameworks.
* Get line length from Python code style settings.
* Hook into standard "Reformat Code" command.
* Detection of possible conflicts with other plugins / File Watchers.
* Better integration with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Special usage example
* run the blackd Daemon on a remote server in docker like this https://hub.docker.com/r/paterit/blackd
